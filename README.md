# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

#### This is the high level overview of all the Data Science and Machine Learning projects I have been working on. For more details about each of these projects, please follow the link and review the Readme document for the individual project. 

#### Technologies Used 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn 

#### Projects

1. [Large Language Model](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/LargeLanguageModel)

In this project, I’ve built a large language model from scratch using the transformer architecture. Each component of the transformer has been manually implemented to provide a clear understanding of how a language model functions. You can follow the code and comments in the Jupyter 
notebooks to explore the inner workings of the model.

2. [Computer Vision Experiments with PyTorch](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/CompVision_Pytorch_Experiments)

In this project, I’ve used the PyTorch library to train a RESNET Neural Network on ImageNet dataset. It covers the basics of how to create a RESNET, pre-process data before training, train and then use a saved RESNET configuration to make predictions on new images. You can follow the code and comments in the Jupyter notebooks to explore the inner workings of the model.

3. [Euro Satellite Image Processing for Land Usage](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/EuroSatelliteDataProcessing)

   
7. [Satellite Image Segmentation for Water](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/SatelliteImageProcessing)
8. [Reinforced Learning](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/reinforced_learning)
9. [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/unsupervised_learning)
